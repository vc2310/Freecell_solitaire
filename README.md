# Freecell_solitaire

Developed this code for "Freecell solitaire" which checks for every move made by the player. If a valid move, it would make those specific changes to the board otherwise would not let one move. This code was developed using the Module interface Specification which can be found under the "report" directory.

Thank you and feel free to check if you are making a valid move or not :)
